# UFOs
## Overview of the analysis:
### Our webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, the purpose of this analysis is to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, you can add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.
## Results:
#### We can see our Webpage image below :

#### You will notice that a "Filter Search" section has been added.

### You can filter by one or all of the search criteria shown. For example, if you search by state and shape, you can see the table only for that state and shape.

### One more example, if you search by "City" like "El Cajon", you will see that the table updated to show the reported sightings that was recorded for that city.

## Summary:
### This webpage has some drawbacks like, there is no button to click that tells the user that the table will update after you hit enter and  search field is "case-sensitive". The table will not update if you do not enter exactly how the data is stored and does not allow for partial entries.
###  We can have some additional recommendations for further development:
### We can make the page more interactive by adding click buttons.  In every field, we can add N/A in dropdown List, so user can understand that it is not nessesury to fill every feild, and we can provide one additional link to guide user how to search.
